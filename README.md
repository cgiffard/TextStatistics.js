TextStatistics.js
=================

JavaScript port of [TextStatistics.php](https://github.com/DaveChild/Text-Statistics)!

I've done what I think is a reasonably faithful port. Documentation incoming!
I removed a lot of the original comments during the port, but seeing as the API remained largely the same, I'll add them in shortly.

The beginning of a test suite in [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) is here, covering cleaning the text and some cases of word and sentence counting.

## Installation

Run this in the browser using a simple `<script>` include - or you can install for node with `npm install text-statistics`.
